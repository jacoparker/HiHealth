# HiHealth

This is the main project for CS506.

## Project Abstract

Patients, especially those with chronic diseases, need to keep track of their medication and health. Depending on the disease, a patient might have to use external devices, reminders, multiple apps, etc. just to monitor their health. HiHealth provides patients with a new experience where they will be able to monitor their health by tracking medications and symptoms. The app will remind the patient to take their prescription by sending multiple notifications until they record the time in which the medication was taken. The app will also keep the user informed on common symptoms and advise them to call doctors if serious symptoms are noticed. HiHealth keeps track of all data by organizing them in a calendar which facilitates monitoring health conditions.
